Echocardiography reveals total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR), in which the pulmonary veins fail to connect to the left atrium. Instead, they drain into systemic veins. Which embryologic process failed in this condition?",
        "choices": [
            "Regression of the left sinus venosus",
            "Involution of the right vitelline veins",
            "Incorporation of the pulmonary venous plexus into the left atrium",
            "Abnormal partitioning of the truncus arteriosus",
            "Failure of endocardial cushion development"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "TAPVR results from failure of the pulmonary venous plexus to incorporate into the left atrium. This leads to systemic venous drainage of oxygenated blood, requiring an ASD or PDA for survival."
